## <div id="overview">Overview</div>

Moodle Mate is an advanced Python application designed to streamline the process of receiving Moodle notifications. It fetches notifications from Moodle, summarizes them using GPT-3 or GPT-4 and sends them to the user via Pushbullet and Discord. The application is designed to run on a server and can be configured to run at specific intervals.

Utilizes GPT-3.5-turbo for cost-effective operations (under 15 cents/month, excluding server costs).

## <div id="dependencies">Dependencies</div>

The software relies on the following custom API wrappers and libraries:

- **MoodleAPI**: Interface for the Moodle API
- **OpenAI**: Interface for the OpenAI API
- **Pushbullet**: Interface for the Pushbullet API
- **Discord**: Utilizes webhooks for Discord integration.

## <div id="installation">Installation</div>

Clone the repository and install the Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvickaStudio/Moodle-Mate.git
cd Moodle-Mate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## <div id="configuration">Configuration</div>

A configuration file, `config.ini`, is necessary for the application's operation. It should contain:

- Moodle URL
- Moodle Username & Password
- OpenAI API Key
- Pushbullet API Key
- Pushbullet State (1: Activated, 0: Deactivated)
- Webhook State (1: Activated, 0: Deactivated)
- Discord Webhook URL
- System Message for GPT-3 (Default in German)
- Set GPT model, standard gpt-3.5-turbo (recommend: gpt-4-1106-preview)

Example:

```ini
[moodle]
; Moodle URL for API access
moodleUrl = https://subdomain.example.com/
; Username and password for Moodle login
username = 123456
password = password
; API key for OpenAI and Pushbullet
openaikey = sk-xxxxx
pushbulletkey = o.xxxxx
; Activate or deactivate Pushbullet and Discord
pushbulletState = 0 ; 1: Activated, 0: Deactivated
webhookState = 1
; Discord webhook URL
webhookUrl = https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxxx/xxxxx
; System message for GPT-3 summarization
systemMessage = "YOUR SYSTEM PROMPT HERE, EXAMPLE IN config_example.ini"
; Set GPT model, standard gpt-3.5-turbo
model = gpt-3.5-turbo
```
