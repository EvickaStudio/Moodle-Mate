# Optional Virtual Environment Setup

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To do so, follow these steps:

**On Windows:**

```powershell
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On Linux / macOS:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
