# General rules for AI 

- Prior to generating any code, carefully read the project conventions and guidelines
  - Read [project-design.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-design.mdc) to understand the codebase
  - Read [project-conventions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc) to understand _how_ to write code for the codebase
  - Read [ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc) to understand how to implement frontend code specifically
- Ignore i18n methods and files. Hardcode strings in English for now to optimize speed of development.
