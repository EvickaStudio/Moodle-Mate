# Create PR

## Overview

Open a clean, well-documented PR with tests and context for reviewers.

## Steps

1. Prep branch: rebase onto main; ensure working tree clean; run tests (`pytest` or targeted).
2. Draft PR description: what/why, risks, testing performed, config/env changes (.env keys, ports), UI screenshots if applicable.
3. Create PR with descriptive title; add reviewers/labels; link related issues.
4. Call out breaking changes or follow-ups; keep diff focused (no unrelated formatting).

## Checklist

- [ ] Branch rebased; tests pass.
- [ ] Description covers what/why/risks/testing/config changes.
- [ ] Reviewers/labels/issues linked; screenshots for UI.
- [ ] No unrelated churn; breaking changes/follow-ups noted.
